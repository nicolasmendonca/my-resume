## About Me

![profile-pic](./images/profile.jpg)

I'm a passionate, self-taught 24 yo web developer, located in Buenos Aires, Argentina :argentina:.
Actually, i'm focused on front end technologies, such as:
- React.js
- Redux (redux-thunk & redux-sagas)
- styled-components
- Progressive Web Applications

I'm determined to provide users a great UI. And I'm convinced that this goal can only be achieved with a solid team communication, in order to build a great product.  

## What i'm working on now...

I am taking part as Ssr Web UI Developer at [Intive](https://www.intive.com/), building [Intelligize](https://www.intelligize.com/products/intelligize/). An app for data analysis on public legal documents.

For building solid and scalable products at a fast pace, i believe that testing is the only way to go. That's why over 90% of the code i write is covered by tests. On React.js, i usually write unit tests with **Jest** and **Enzyme**.
For UI testing, we use **Storybook** with all the reusable components, hosted on a external monorepo.
